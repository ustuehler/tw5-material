title: Related Tiddlers View Template
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Tiddlers tagged with the current one are automatically listed below the main tiddler view template, unless the current tiddler has the `view-related` field set to `no`.  The <$list filter="[all[shadows+tiddlers]field:view-related[no]first[]]"/> tiddler is an example of a tiddler that has `view-related` set to `no`. The <$list filter="[all[shadows+tiddlers]field:view-related[yes]first[]]"/> tiddler on the other hand has `view-related` set to `yes` and should list some related tiddlers.
