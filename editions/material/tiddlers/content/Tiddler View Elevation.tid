title: Tiddler View Elevation
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Tiddler views are rendered with the class `mdc-elevation--z1`, by default. CSS transitions defined in [[$:/themes/ustuehler/material/base]] elevate tiddler views to `mdc-elevation--z10` when being hovered over.

There is a known issue with this feature: Any tiddlers opened after the page was first loaded will not show the elevation transition. This can probably be [[worked around|https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24148403/trigger-css-transition-on-appended-element]] with some modification to the [[PageTemplate|$:/themes/ustuehler/material/ui/PageTemlate]].
