!! [[Unreleased|https://github.com/ustuehler/tw5-material/compare/material/v0.1.3...HEAD]]
!!! Added
* Added the `captiontitles` theme option (defaults to `yes`). This will show the caption instead of the tiddler title, if the caption field exists.
!! 0.1.3
!!! Changed
* Floating Action Button is now hidden by default, but can be enabled under [[Theme Tweaks|$:/themes/ustuehler/material/themetweaks]].
* Removed e-mail related items from the drawer and split the drawer into `$:/tags/Drawer` and `$:/tags/DrawerBottom` sections.
!! 0.1.2
!!! Changed
* Floating Action Button now creates a new tiddler that is tagged with the current one. In order to have access to the `currentTiddler` variable it had to be moved into the ViewTemplate.
